# 8B/10B Encoder/Decoder

This project focuses on the implementation of an 8B/10B encoder and decoder for Ethernet PHY using Python. The 8B/10B encoding scheme is widely used in high-speed communication systems to ensure reliable and efficient data transmission. The project also includes verification of the implemented encoder/decoder using MATLAB.

## Features

- **8B/10B Encoding:** The project includes an implementation of the 8B/10B encoding scheme, which converts 8-bit data into 10-bit code groups. This encoding technique ensures DC balance and provides sufficient transition density for clock recovery.

- **8B/10B Decoding:** The decoder module can successfully recover the original 8-bit data from the encoded 10-bit code groups. It handles the decoding process by identifying and correcting any errors introduced during transmission.

- **Python Implementation:** The encoder and decoder are implemented using Python programming language, which offers flexibility, ease of use, and a wide range of available libraries for data manipulation and analysis.

- **Verification with MATLAB:** The implemented 8B/10B encoder and decoder are verified using MATLAB. The verification process includes comparing the output of the encoder/decoder with expected results to ensure the accuracy and correctness of the implementation.
